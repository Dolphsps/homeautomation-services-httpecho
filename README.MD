## HTTP-ECHO Service

This is a test service for various purposes including:
* nomad hosting
* waypoint build and deploy
* consul service discovery
* traefik load balancing

With time I may add other services such as vault & boundary.



The service endpoint should do nothing other than output basic text in a browser.
